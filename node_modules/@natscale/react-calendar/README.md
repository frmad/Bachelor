import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

    (value) => {
      setValue(value);
    },

## :memo: Motivation

The idea of creating a calendar component was a result of trying to find something online which could handle my requirements without needing me to hack away at the component's internals and possibly breaking it;

ergo, this react calendar which aims to be a one stop shop for every potential use case a web developer could think of when it comes to calendars and dates. All the featues I included are ones I thought would be most required from a calendar component. Any suggestions or updates are always welcome to make it more robust.
